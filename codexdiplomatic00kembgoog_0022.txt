The distinctions between even the slightest differences
in the face of the country are marked with a richness
and accuracyof language which will surprise all those
who bave not noticed a similar phaenomenon inthere-
moto provinces 'of Englund. Ou‘ the other hand, the
artificial constructione enable us to glauce at the pri·
vate lise, as it were, os the people; to argue upon the
mode of culture, their enclosures, hedges, weirs,
barns,<houses, mille, mines, quarries, etc., etc.

Before, however, we proceed to notice these words
in detail, it will be desirable to remark one circum·

people‚ and partially in our literature. Many, then,
