Ηῑ11 (t), lida· the κλῆρος, lot, or haeredium os the free-
man. Grimm’s derivation of the word from byd,
N.h.g. haut, an ox-hide, (as is a space measured by
thongs 01 ropes 01 1000100) D.R.A., p. 538, is cer·
tainly erroneous. It is much more probable that
its root is to be found in the root of higan, hiwan,
familia. Its uncontracted form, higid, occurs in
No. 243; 01111 it there seems to denote as much
land as belongs to, 01 will support, one family. On
this supposition, it was probably at first an uncer-
tain quantity, varying according to the richness of
the land, or the extent capable of being divided
among a certain number of claimants. But it
seems at length to have settled down into 0 fixed
amount3 at least, Beda refers to particular estates
or districts as being of so many hides, juxta men-
suram Anglorum, H. Eccles. hh. i. c. 25; ii. c. 9;
iii. c. 43 iv. 0. 16. According to my calculations,
the hide contained very nearly thirty acres of our
present measurement. The words used in the
charters as equivalent to hid, 010 Mansus, Mansa,
Mansio, Manens, Cessatus, Hiwisc, Terra tributarii,
Familia. The lastword is exclusively used byBeda.
