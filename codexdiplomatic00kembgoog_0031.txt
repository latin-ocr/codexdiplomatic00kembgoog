xxiv rasurus.

Efise, efeso (f.), the coca, No. 608. This is not con-
fined to the eaves oi a house, as with us; although
the term yfesdrype, in No. 296, shows that it had
that signification, as well as the legal custom
founded thereupon: but it applies also to the over-
hanging edge ol a wood, tho rim or hrink.

Ero, No. 570, most probably a false reading sor

Ersc (m.), the arch, odish‚ astermath or stabbla, No.

‚represent an earlier u, not an i,· that -is, to corre·
,spond withan Old German fani, not fini. But
thero are other words which tend to render this
conclusion doubtful; as Populfinig‚ in No. 652,
Α which I cannot at all explain. 'There isan adj.
