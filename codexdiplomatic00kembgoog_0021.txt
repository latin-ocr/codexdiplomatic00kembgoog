xiv rnnrnon

Hnikarr‚ or to some supernatural being connected
with that particular superstition. similarly, I consider
Scyldes tre6w, No. 436, au a reference to woden in
his form ol Scyld, a name never to my knowledge
borne by an individual. And as Scyld appears in the
fine epic of Beewulf, so do Hnaes (Hnaefes scyls, No.
¹ 595), Betwulf (Be6wan ham, No. 353), Grendel
(Grendles mere, No. 353; Grindeles pyt, No. 593
Grindles hece, No. 570), reappear in local names.
Weawan born, No. 535, is probably equivalent to
Souocan orde6fles born, that is wodnes. In No. 304
we have burs or byns-pyt, which I will not refer to
any particular god. Iam not so certain respecting
Wadan hiesu, No. 18, Wadan bergas, No. 55, as
Wada might be merely a man’s name; while Wad-
beorh is probably only the Wood bill, from the mat-
ter under culture. Nor is Bleocan mere, No. 274,
quite certain. However, enough has been said to
show that many interesting coincidences between our
Senon⁴ forelathers and their Germanic kiusmen can
yet be recovered; and when we consider that the
names oi animale which most frequently occur may
¹all have some connection either with the worship oi
certain gods, or with the old poem os Reynard, we
find the traces oi such connection in our local names
by no means, scanty,

The lastgeneral division that it seems proper to
mention, contains the names oi individuale and lami-
lies‚ as Offan ham, Csritredes tre6W‚ Heardinga ham,
Billinga h63 and those ofpartionlar classes or tradere
or m'anulaoturers, as sealtera broc, tannera hol, ceorla
graf, aeoelinga ham, witena leah.

The nature os the second word in these com·

ponnds is necessarily somewhat different. Itis in
short the description either of a natural feature of the
country, a hill, a stream, a ford3 or ol an artili-
cialconstruction, feld, aecer, ceaster, tun, burh, ham.
