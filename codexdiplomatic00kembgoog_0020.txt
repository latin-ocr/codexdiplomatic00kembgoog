they are such as were strikingly impressed upon the
nativas os a particular locality, although themselves of
a general character3 thus, Chester: or, lastly, they ere
names so altered hy the Saxons themselves from
British originals, as to have lost their natural form
and character3 thus, Lunden, Eoforwic.

The former portion of these compounded names
may be classed under various heads: thus names of
animals, as Fox·hyl, Oteres sceaga, Beier-burne,
Swines heaf0d3 of birds, as Lasercan beorh, Eneda
mere, Hafoces hyl, Hraefnes hyl; oi trees, as Beorc-
leah, Ac·leah, AEsc·leah; of fisheS, as Fixa broc,
Lex-pon of minerals, as Sand-tfin, Ceosel-burne,
Salt-broc.

Others again have clearly reference to mythologi-
cal or divine personages3 to names recorded in the
old creed, or in the epos of our forefathers: aud to

’ these a deep interest necessarily attaches‚ inasmuch

as they furnish the most conclusive evidence that the
mythology current in Germany and Scandinavia flour-
· ished here also. Thus we have Wodnes dic, W6dnes
beorh, Wbdnes byrig, Wbdnes seld3 perhaps also,
W6dnes tre6w, W6dnes stede, Wodnes sord: and to
these I do not scruple to add iia who-hlinc, No. 3793
lia Ἤδη-ἑο, Νο. 495; lia W6n·stoc, No. 657; pcr-
haps aa Wotan·hlinc, No. 5433 oaet Wottre6W, No.
595. The record os Dunor is comparatively rare,
but still we have Dunresseld, Nos. 270, 418. Saeteres

’ byrig, like Steteresdaeg, seems to speak ior the exist·

ence os some deity yet unknown to us. It may be
questioned whether AEres hlinc, No. 247, does not
imply some worship of Tiw under another name; and
in Tyes mere (probably Tiwes) we have another re·
cord of the same god, No. 242. Berhtan wyl, No.
311, leaves, I think, no doubt about Berhte or
Beorbte, the goddess of wells. Hnices born, No.
268, appears to refer either to Wbden in the form of
