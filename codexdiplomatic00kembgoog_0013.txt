which, being for the most part written in the vernacu-

attention at the hand of the inquirer.¹

But, besides these, the covenants and detailed
agreements or conditione by which several of the
grants are accompanied, enable ns to form a much
clearer conception than might have been anticipated
of the social state of England. They arethusio many
respects more valnable than the mere references to the
public life and relations of govemment, inasmuch as
these last are at all times and in all placeS, greatly
modified and limited by them. The public life is, in
short, the outgrowth and crown of the private life and
domestic habits of a nation.

The principal difference, however, between this and
the two preceding volumes‚ lies in the publication here

with the charter to which it belongs. Ido not scruple
to assert that no collection exists in Europe which
throws so much light upon the mode of settling, the
land-divisions, tilth, and general condition of the Ger-
manic ranae, as this collection os boundaries. Itis
unnecessary now to explain why the whole were not
given in the former volumeS. Let it suffice that what·
ever difficulties intervened are now removed, that
every charter will henceforth be accompanied by its
boundaries, and that an Appendix to this collection
contains the greater part of those which were omitted
on the previous occasions. I have good hope that all
will in time be recovered, and that the subject will
thus be left in a state of completeness which I did not
venture to contemplate when I first devoted myself to
its investigation.

In order that the arrangement now adopted may
