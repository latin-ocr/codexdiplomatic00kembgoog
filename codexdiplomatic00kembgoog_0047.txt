,Puuuacu

stricted sense, is that os a dwelliog‚ a homestead,
the house aud iuland; all, in short, that is sur-
rounded and bounded by a hedge or fence. Itis
thus capable of being used to express what we
mean by the word town, viz. a largo collection of
dwellings3 or, like the Scottish town, even a solitary
farmhouse. It is very remarkable, that the largest
proportior of the names of places among the An-
glosaxous should have been formed with this word,
while upon the continent of Europe it is never used
for such a purpose. Iu the first two volumes of
the Codex Diplomaticus, Dr. Leo computes the
proportion of local names compounded with tfin at
one eighth of the whole number, aratio which un·
avoidablyleads us to the conclusion that enclosurcs
were as much favoured by the Anglosaxons as
they were avoided by their German brethren bc-
youd the sea.
