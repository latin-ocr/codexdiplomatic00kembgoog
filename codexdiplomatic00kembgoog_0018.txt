junction oi any two estates2would he a name for the
boundary os either cr both, aad pomero must then be
considered as a corruption ol cymmer. This word is
· composed os the preposition aym, which has alwaysa

Α collective power, and the noun mer, which denotes

something- thathee, or is stationary3 aud cymmer there-
fore means, that which lies together. In composition,
however, we do not always find the word iu its full
form: thus we have, in No. 335, both gemaer-stan
and mer-stain, the boundary stone; iu N o. 570, gemat·
br6c and mer-broc, the boundary hrook; in No. 549,
maerheg, mffirweg3 and numerous other instances
which it is needless to multiply.

A more genuine, though much less common word
is maore, (seo landmearc, No. 633) the mark or
march, in its proper and restricted sense ol a boun·
dary. Occasionally it occurs to denote the limits os
a private estate, and there can then be no question
ns to its identity with gemero. Its other, wider ,
meanings need not occupy us now. As the houndary
is generally defined by signs or marks, there is nc
difficulty iu consideriug this word as identical inform
and meaning with our own word mork3 indeed, it is
probable that the latter is only a derivative sense,
dependent upon thesormer.¹ But still its meaning
requires explanation. The true correspondent to
mark is the Latin margo, dprov3 and this would ap-
pear satisfactory, but sor the Old Norse forms. In
this lauguage there are two distinct words: M'drk,
gen. markar, aloc, which is seminium and Mark, or
merki, limes, which is neuter. The words rudrk and
myrkr‚ obscurus mark, murky, are connected 3 and pro·
bably the first sense os m'drk itsels may be derived
from its closeness, darkness, and obscurity. From
this, which Ι give nearly in the words of Grimm‚¹
