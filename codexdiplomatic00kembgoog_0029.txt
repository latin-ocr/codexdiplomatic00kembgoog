vowel eo, or 1ο, ser e, gives some weight to Dr. Leo's
supposition that it is adopted from the Celtic; he
cites dion as Gaelic and Erse ior any quiet, protected
spot: and to this we may add the Welsh 1111, still,
undisturbed, quiet; as, dien lanerq, a pleasant mea·

Dic (1.), 1111111111, both which words are in use in
our· provinces to express the same thing, viz.
the continuous hollow made by digging. The
corresponding N.h.g. Teich is c pond, and not a

from the understanding3 it sees in the dile or ditch

No. 442, and other cases, a masculine genitive
dices: and in No. 620 there is a very remarkable
variation3' the word dic occurs five times indispu-
tably masculine, four times in the accusative singu-
lar, with adjectives that leave no question as to the
gender, and once in the dative, which is equally
conclusive. But it also occurs twice in the femi·
nine, and in amanner equally beyond doubt. This
suggests the possibility of the two genders having
been used to distinguish between the ditch and dile,
