sious, It compels usto reject any derivation ot' the
word from mor, mcor, and anyimmediate connection
with m'e‘re, a merc or lake: although in flat lands
there can be no doubt that moors, marshes and lakes
were proper and usual boundaries. But nothing can
be urged against the reading pomero :· it is found in al·
most every case, and universally in pure Saxon docu-
ments3 it cannot therefore be supposed an error for
pomero, and all thought of mor must be relinquished,
for no conceivable process could transform 6 into ae,
although, under certain circumstances it necessarily
becomes ’6. Against this peculiarity os the Anglosaxon
we may indeed set the Old Norse maeri, landamaeri‚

Westphalian documenta of the ninth century 3 and the
New·netherlandish meet, lima,- meeren, limitare. But
even the Old Nosse· forms may be more probably
maeri, landamaeri, having some reference perhaps to
the Friesic mar, pl. msam, which however rather im-

ledges his inability to discover any satisfactory root for
these last forms, and for pomero.. Under all these
'circumstances 1 am rather inclined to seek the origin
ofpeovaero in the language of those among whom the
Saxons settled.

British spoken hy the Loegrians stood to that of the
Cymri3 but in the latter tongne there is found the
compound word aym-mer, a junctim or arwam and
this seems sufficient to mark theline along which one
monor, district, or even private estate, was contermin-
ous with another„ In this sense, and supposing the
expression to have been horrowed by the Saxons from
their Celtic neighboum, the word which denoted the
