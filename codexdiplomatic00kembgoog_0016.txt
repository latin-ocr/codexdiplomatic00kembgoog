suspicion that it is not in reality Teutonic. Grimm,
in his Grenzaltertbiimer,¹ reluctantly hints at a Slavo-
nic origin3 which we cannot admit, unless we assume
the Anglosaxons to have received the word from
Slavonic neighbours‚ before their migration from the
banks of the Vistula to those of the Elbe: but then
would arise the difficult question, Why the Sla-
vonians did not give the same word to the other Ger·
man populations with whom they came into much
closer contact in various parts of the continent.

The only Anglosaxon word which appears cog-
nate with pomero, is the adjective mare, foraneus, ia-
siyais‚· and the notion that some connection subsists
between them is rendered the more plausible by ex-
pressions which frequently occur in the charters them-
selves, via. tormini artimino, manibus aortprtsoa or culpari
relatione cogniti, etc. etc. If this be admitted, we must
take the word to mean something famous or celebrated,
something pre-eminently, and above all other things,
well-known3 and this the ,boundaries which were
under the guardianship of popular tradition, no doubt
either were ‘or were supposed to be. Hence, very
often the bounderies themselves may be genuine and
valuable, although grave suspicion attaches to the
charter in which they are found. Yet this explana-
tion seems to me insufficient: it leaves the word in
a state of isolation which is very unusual, end can
after all be supported only by straining the natural
sense and application of mara. The main difficulty
arises from the form: the Anglosaxon word is inva-

riably written with ὦ, and not with ὃ. This, which
may appear of little consequence to those who
ere not familiar with the strict rules of Teutonic
etymology, does in fact lead to important conclu-
