viii ranrncn.

The boundaries of an Anglosaxon charter are
nearly always in Anglosaxon, even though the grant
to which they appertain should be written in Latin.
The passage which describes them is sometimes insert-
ed in the body of the instrument, sometimes appended
to it, and is very often in a different hand from that of
the grant itself. It seems as if, the grant being duly
made, it was left sor the grantae and certain publio or
local authorities to settle its boundarieS‚ according to
ancient prescription‚ and to have them formally insert·
ed in the document, when once lixed and ascertained.
The boundaries are thus frequently called tormini ao-
tlssimr', and there are'instanoes where they are stated
to be so notorious as to require no description: in
both cases we must assume them to be under the gua-
rantee of the oleariam or neighbourhood, as to this day
the bounds of a parish are3 and we shall not take an
unwarrantable liberty is we suggest that the remem-
brance of them was kept up in a similar way. In
general, certain well-defined natural objects, as a hill,
a stream, ora remarkable tree, furnished the points by
which the boundary line was directed; when these
were wanting, a hedge‚ a ditch, a pit or well, or the
mound os an ancient warrior, served the purpose;
even posts of wood and stone appear to have been
common, and upon many of these it is prohable¹ that
inscriptions were found. It may safely be assumed
that originally these boundaries were under the pro-
tection os Woden; and various traces of his influence
yet remain.

The word which is almost exclusively used to de·

note the boundarieS‚ is pomero, a neuter plural, whose
singular is camare. It seems nearly confined to the
AnglosaxonS, other words having been appropriated
in Germany to express its meaning: but it is not
easily explained by the forms of the Anglosaxon it-
solf3 and this fact, coupled with the absence of the
