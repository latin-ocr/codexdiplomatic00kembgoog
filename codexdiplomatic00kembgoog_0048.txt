place, of one or more houses: Werburgingwic,
villu repulia No. 217; saltwic, niens captoriae solis,

to take up a station, probably to run on shoreat
night, applied to a ship: Oros. bk. i. p. 25.

’ same form, denoting a march, which he derives from
a verbal form, wic; wan, wicon; wicen; and con-
sequently looks upon as cognate to the adj. wac,
mollis. This requires confirmationi although some
plausibility is given to the suggestion, partly by
the frequent use of the termination -wiclr in places
near salt-pools, and hy the occurrence of such
