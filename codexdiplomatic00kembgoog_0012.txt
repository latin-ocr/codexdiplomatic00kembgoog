OODEX DIPLOMATIOUS AEVI SAXONIOI.

TOM. III.

Tun Third volume of the Codex Diplomaticus em·
braces a period of about forty years: it brings down
the documentary history of England to the close of
AEbelrffed's unhappy reign, and the commencement of
the new constitution of Gnut, leaving only a few years
of disturbed aud troublous character for another vo·
lume. To these documentS, however, will be added a
large number of charters, aud abstracts of charters,
either omitted unavoidably or by inadvertency in the
earlier volumes, or such as have been discovered since
those were compiled. It is further my intention to
include in the next volume the Fasti, Indexes, and
other Tables, which are necessary to the full use of
the whole work. .

Ι feel that to the philologist, the historico, and even
the antiquarian‚ the present collection will be incomr
parably more valuable than the two which bave pre-
ceded it. Not that, indeed, the period from Eadgar
to AEbelrffid is in itself of more importance than those
from AEttelberht to Ecghmht, or Ecgberbt to Eadgan
but that, through accidental circumstances, a compa·
ratively large number of documents belonging to it
have survived which throw light upon the domestic
manners and mode of life of our forefathers.

Such, more particularly, are the wius, Leases, and
Settlements, which are numerous in this volume, aud
