Ι can hope, bnt I do hope it sincerely. Indecd,
taking into consideration the great value of these local
terme, and the insight they are calculated to a'fford
into the manner of culture, the state of the country,
and other interesting details of social life among the
AnglosaxonS, it would be most desirable that a com-
plete index of them should be made, with a reference
to every word. Such a compilation would prove of
great advantage to those who have devoted their ener· ’
gies to the investigation of our provincial dialectst it
would serve to show that many words, which now
survive only in obscure and distant localities, once had
currency over the whole country, and were parts of
the general language of our forefathers; and to give a
far more satisfactory explanation of the words them-
selves than can be gained from consulting Danish or
Swedish dictionarieS, at hap-hazard.

The improved state of philological and historical
study during the last few years offers encouragement
and support to the inquirer. In every part of Europe
eamest and judicious efforts are now made to recover
the documentary evidence in which early history finds
its surest foundation3 and a wide and generous sys-
tem of philology enables us to use such materials with
security and profit. Ι feel the highest satisfaction, as
I approach the termination of this work, in the know-
ledge that England will no longer be pointed out as
an exception to the general rule; that our earliest
documentary history is now made accessible to all who
will bestow reasonable pains upon its acquisition3 and
that the stores of increased knowledge, which are thus
laid open to the philologist, the jurist, and the anti·
quarian, will produce results to be felt far beyond the
limits of this country, perhaps even of this age.
