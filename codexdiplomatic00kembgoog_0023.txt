Cymri, from whose practice they were adopted by the
victorious Saxeus, in all parts of the country3 they
are not Anglosaxon, but Welsh (i. e. foreign, Wylisc),
very frequently unmoditied either in meaning or pro-
nunciation. It will be easily conceived that Ι ap-
proach this portion of the subject with great diffi-
dence, as I do not pretend to possess any knowledge
of the Celtic languages3 but the authorities which
have been consulted are considered sound by those
who have a better right than myself to form an
opinion upon the subject.

It appears desirable to throw the most usual of
these words into an alphabetical arrangement, so as
to ferm a little glossary fer general reference while
usingthis volume. ldo not hold ont any hope that
this will dispense with a knowledge of the rules os
Anglosaxon grammar, or the words commonly cur·
rent in Anglosaxon literature. A rational work,
undertaken hy the nation, would ne doubt supply
translations at length, and annotations to all difficult
passages. But the Historical Society makes no such
pretensions, has no such powers, and claims no such
position, as the representative of the nation for these
purposes. lt voluntarily aids, as far as it can, the
industrious inquiren bnt to him it says, that ne one
can study the early history os England without
making himself familiar with the language, which is
'the best index to the social condition of the country,
and the depository of the most important sacts con·
nected with its developement.
